### I have a webpage!

And I can put all kinds of stuff on it!

I can add additional text.

I *could* write some code but i'm not going to.


### Add some links

I like [to look for code on the internet](https://www.google.com).

I can link directly to my [about page](about.html).


### Picture of my dog

Ain't she great:

<img src = "images/heres_my_dog.png" style = "width:105%">


### I can add code

My code page is [here](code.html).
